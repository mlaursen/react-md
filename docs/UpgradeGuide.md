### NavigationDrawer
The `NavigationDrawer` component was redone to respond to different device sizes better.

Some of the required changes:

- `isOpen` - Has been removed.  See [onDrawerChange](#ondrawerchange) for new functionality.
- `style` - Has been renamed to `drawerStyle` to better match existing naming conventions.
- `className` - Has been renamed to `drawerClassName` to better match existing naming conventions.
- `containerStyle` - Has been renamed to `style` to better match existing naming conventions.
- `containerClassName` - Has been renamed to `className` to better match existing naming conventions.
- `title` - Has been renamed to `drawerTitle` to be more specific.
- `openDrawer` - Has been removed. See [onDrawerChange](#ondrawerchange) for new functionality.
- `closeDrawer` - Has been removed. See [onDrawerChange](#ondrawerchange) for new functionality.
- `drawerType` - Has been removed. See [Responsive Drawer Changes](#respnsive-drawer-changes) for new functionality.
- `navHeader` - Has been removed.
- `navHeaderChildren` - Has been renamed to `drawerChildren` for clarity.
- `autoclose` - New boolean prop that will automatically close the drawer on the temporary drawer types when a nav item is clicked if this is set to `true`.

#### Responsive Drawer Changes
The `drawerType` prop has been removed so that there is now a specific drawer type
at different media sizes.

Six props: `mobileDrawerType`, `mobileMinWidth`, `tabletDrawerType`, `tabletMinWidth`, `desktopDrawerType`, and `desktopMinWidth`
have been created to help with the media flows.

The mobile drawer type can only be temporary or temporary mini, while the tablet and desktop
drawer types can be any varient.

The `mobileDrawerType` will be chosen if the `mobileMinWidth` matches in the media query
and the max width is less than `desktopMinWidth - 1`.

The `tabletDrawerType` will be used if the `tabletMinWidth` matches in the media query
and the max width is less than `desktopMinWidth - 1` and the device orientation is `landscape`.
If the device orientation, the `mobileDrawerType` will be used instead.

The `desktopDrawerType` will be used if the media query matches the `desktopMinWidth`.

There is also a new prop: `initialDrawerType` that will help with Server Side Rendering. This should either be `'mobile'`, `'tablet'`, or `'desktop'`. It will then set the drawer type to the corresponding drawer type on initial render. (Before it always rendered the desktop until it was fully mounted). This new prop should be used along with the `initiallyOpen` prop to render the mobile devices correctly without forcing the menu to open and close initially.


#### onDrawerChange

Definition: `onDrawerChange(isDrawerOpen)`

Since the `openDrawer` and `closeDrawer` props were removed, you can get the current
drawer open state by adding a `onDrawerChange` prop. This function will give you
a boolean for the next open state of the drawer. It will be triggered when a media
resize happens that changes the open state, or when the user toggles it for a temporary
or persistent drawer.
