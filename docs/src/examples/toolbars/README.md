The `Toolbar` component can be used as a fixed `App Bar`, or just a simple container
for a few actions.

When you are using a `fixed` Toolbar (aka `App Bar`), if you apply the `.md-toolbar-relative`
class name to the main content of the page (or something you want adjusted), it will
gain a margin-top equal to the current height of the toolbar based on the device/screen
size.
