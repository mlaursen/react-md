Dialogs contain text and UI controls focused on a specific task.  They inform users about critical
information, require users to make decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

it will trap keyboard focus within the dialog while opened. When the dialog is closed, the previously
focused element will be focused again. These additions have been added base on the
