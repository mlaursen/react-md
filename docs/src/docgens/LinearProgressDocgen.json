[{"description":"There are 3 different types of linear progress bars: `Determinate`,\n`Indeterminate`, and `Query Indeterminate`.\n\nA `Determinate` linear progress bar should be used when you can keep track of the\nprogress and have a percentage complete you can work with. An example would be\nuploading/downloading a file.\n\nAn `Indeterminate` linear progress bar should be used when you can not keep track\nof the progess yourself. An example might be waiting for an API call to complete.\n\nA `Query Indeterminate` linear progress bar is used when you are combining\n`Indeterminate` and `Determinate`. A Linear Progress component can be displayed\nas a query indeterminate progress bar by adding the prop `query={true}` to the\ncomponent. Until a progress value is given, it will display the query linear\nprogress animation. Afterwards, it will start the determinate animation of where\nyou manually keep updating the value of the progress.","methods":[],"props":{"className":{"type":{"name":"string"},"required":false,"description":"An optional className to apply to the linear progress container."},"value":{"type":{"name":"custom","raw":"(props, propName, component, ...others) => {\n  if (typeof props[propName] === 'undefined') { return null; }\n  let err = PropTypes.number(props, propName, component, ...others);\n  if (!err) {\n    const value = props[propName];\n    if (!isBetween(value, 0, 100)) {\n      err = new Error(\n        `A determinate '${component}' was given a value '${value}'.
