## April 2018
### v1.3.0 Released
Unfortunately I had to cut the scope of this release from what was originally targeted due to burn out and other things. I am going
to be remaking my release schedule and planning to help alleviate this going forward and hopefully make bugs and features easier for
contributors to pick up.

This release only contains 2 new features and a change for how the ES6 modules are compiled.

#### Changelog
- Updated the `TimePicker` to also toggle on selecting seconds for a time. ([@abbiecat] - [pull-722])
  - You can check out the example [here](/components/pickers/time#auto-ok-hover-modes-and-showing-seconds) for some small updates.
  - This also updated the default styles of pickers to be a [bit larger](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/pull/722/commits/503411fe1229ae11d8fb22a62f4e4502967f463a#diff-9d7699b2e3d791845de32c718e51fb7d).
- Updated the `SelectionControlGroup` component to allow custom control components to be rendered instead of only the `SelectionControl` component. ([@bioslife] - [pull-725])
  - You can check out the example [here](/components/selection-controls#selection-control-group-custom-selection-control-component) for some more details.
- Updated the ES6 modules export so that it correctly compiles to multiple files instead of a single UMD bundle. Unfortunately this did not seem to fix the
[code splitting bug](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/issues/587) as there are things I am doing incorrectly in the internal code and will have to be fixed
at another time. [commit-4015310], [commit-ac012b6] and [issues-587]

## March 2018
### v1.2.13 Released
#### Changelog
- Fixed the invalid Scss in the sliders styles. ([@icflorescu] - [pull-712])
  > Also ([@nduc] - [pull-713])

### v1.2.12 Released
This release was a extremely delayed due to the attempted fix of `DatePicker`s displaying incorrectly. This patch _should_
fix the majority of the display errors, but please look over the tickets below for more information especially if you were

- Fixed the `Collapse` prop type error when changing collapsed state. [issues-672]
- Fixed the `DialogContainer`'s invalid PropType warning when setting `fullPage` to `false` and providing a `title`. [issues-700]

#### Website Changes
With the `v1.2.7` release, I also finally documented the [ResizeObserver](/components/helpers/resize-observers) component
that has been exposed in the `UMD` build for awhile now. I also disabled the service workers to see if that stops the weird
React error whenever I update the website and causes a blank page to appear. Finally, I _should_ have fixed the pages animating
in when coming from server side rendering. It should only animate when changing routes now.

[with-typescript](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/tree/release/1.2.x/examples/with-typescript) examples.

### v1.2.2 Released
#### Changelog
- Correctly published to `npm` with the Typescript definition files.

### v1.2.1 Released
#### Changelog
- Correctly exported the new `Grid`, `Cell`, and `GridList` for non-ES6 module imports. [commit-27c86e8]

### v1.2.0 Released
This release was focused on making the entire `react-md` library smaller, adding easier imports, and adding React 16
support. If your bundler supports ES6 modules (webpack 3+), you can now do:
```js
import { NavigationDrawer, ...OtherComponents } from 'react-md';
```

without importing the entire library AND reducing the bundle size compared to:

```js
import NavigationDrawer from 'react-md/lib/NavigationDrawers';
```

The initial update changed production UMD build from 705kB to 361kB as well as changing the entire documentation
server size from 8MB to 5.7MB, so it is a pretty nice difference. Check the changelog below for all the information.

#### Changelog
- Added ES6 module support and switch build from webpack to rollup. [pull-566]
  - Related to [issues-510] and [issues-205]
- Fully implemented React 16 support with React 15 fallback. [pull-576]

- Created three new components: `Grid`, `Cell`, and `GridList` to easily make grids. [pull-573]
  - Related to [issues-507] and [issues-472]. This implemented a "container" system for Grids.
- Update `TableColumn` so the sort icon can appear after the children. ([@cpboone] - [pull-579])
- Added a `Version` so that the current version of react-md can be determined easily. [commit-32ecbc7]

### v1.1.9 Released
#### Changelog
- Fixed the order of the `okProps` and `cancelProps` on the `EditDialogColumn`. [issues-581]

- Updated tooltips to work better in IE11. [issues-574]

### v1.1.7 Released
#### Changelog
- Fixed a Typescript definition for `DatePicker`. ([@noseglid] - [pull-564])

### v1.1.6 Released
This fixed some of the bad markdown linking in my documentation as well as including a few more date picker examples.

#### Changelog
- Fixed the `Slider` when its value is controlled. [issues-561]
- Fixed the `TimePicker` when its value is controlled. [issues-559]

- Exposed additional ways to style the `LinearProgress`. ([@gamtiq] - [pull-550])
- Updated the `focusable` attribute to be a `string` instead of a `boolean` on `SVGIcon`. [commit-849021a]
- Updated the `TextField` `resize` ability to also account for icons. [commit-a20bab4], [commit-58802eb], and [commit-4a5a55c]
- Fixed the `DataTable`'s `Checkbox` displaying weird if there is little content in a table. [issues-549]
- Updated `Collapse` Typescript definition to have `springConfig` optional. ([@noseglid] - [pull-534])
- Updated `DataTable` Typescript definition to include `fullWidth`. ([@noseglid] - [pull-548])

### General Website Updates
This is one of the other exciting things for me. With the release of 1.1.0, the documentation website
has also been rewritten from the ground up for better SSR, response time, and a first pass at offline
mode. List of new features/functionality:
- Added a page about [how to test](/discover-more/testing) along with react-md.
- Added routing examples for the [BottomNavigation](/discover-more/routing-examples/bottom-navigations),
[Drawer](/discover-more/routing-examples/drawers), and [NavigationDrawer](/discover-more/routing-examples/navigation-drawers)
components that show how you can work in with `react-router`'s `Link` component.
- It is now possible to link directly to an example, a component's prop type section, and a specific
component's prop. This is probably more for me than anything else.
  - Link to Example - [Menu Completion View](/components/autocompletes#menu-completion-view)
  - Link to Component's prop type section - [EditDialogColumn](/components/data-tables?tab=1#edit-dialog-column-proptypes)
  - Link to a specific prop - [SVGIcon#role](/components/svg-icons?tab=1#s-v-g-icon-proptypes-role)
- SassDoc will now redirect correctly when clicking on any Sass variable/mixin/function/placeholder in the "Requires",
"Used By", and "See" sections.
- When using the search functionality on the website, Sass variables will now have their values displayed in the autocomplete
list.
- It is now possible to search for specific examples from the main search bar.

### v1.1.4 Released

### v1.1.0 Released
This release **added Typescript support**. It is not completely perfect yet, but it seems to be in a decent
implementation so far. Many thanks to the people who have helped me learn the basics for Typescript definitions
and contributing to fix the missing definitions. ([@peteboothroyd] and [@mctep])

You can see the [milestone for this release](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3Av1.1.0) to see what went in it.
There are also some undocumented changes that should be covered in the [upgrade guide](/discover-more/upgrade-guides/v1.1.0).

A bit too much went into this *minor* release, and I am planning on doing smaller releases from now on. This one was a bit of a disaster to develop.

### Immediate Release Warnings
#### Dialogs
Just in case you don't read the upgrade guide, your application **will break** if you were using the
UMD build for dialogs.

```js
// Before
import { Dialog } from 'react-md';
const { Dialog } = window.ReactMD; // UMD

// After
import { DialogContainer as Dialog } from 'react-md';
const { DialogContainer: Dialog } = window.ReactMD; // UMD
```

#### Data Tables
If you were using the callbacks for when a row or checkbox was clicked, the number will probably be off now. Please see
the [issue for more details](#issues-243).

In addition, the styles for plain data tables have been simplified which might cause some display issues. [commit-2cc40cd]

#### Menus
If you created a custom version of a `Menu`, you need to make sure that one of the children is one of the following:
`.md-text-field-container,button,*[role="button"],*[role="listbox"]` otherwise there will be an error.

## August 2017

##### Changelog

an item. [issues-466]

a value of `0`. [issues-461] and [issues-460]

pressed `shift+tab`. [issues-458]

> this also removed some unneeded transition class names from the `Drawer` when the drawer was "mini" or "permanent".
- Updated the `Drawer` and `NavigationDrawer` components to provide props to style the overlay that gets
created. [issues-389]

## July 2017
### v1.0.17 Released
This patch was mostly about fixing components that needed to be resized after a container height/width
update instead of just a window resize event. In addition, there have been some mobile device performance
and behavior changes. Components that manually added touch events now use passive events when possible and
the user can focus a text field and scroll the page without automatically hiding the keyboard like a native
input element.

##### Changelog
- Fixed the weird page scroll behavior for dialogs when the user closed the dialog by clicking the overlay. [issues-367]
- Updated the ListItem so that you can provide props to the surrounding li node. [issues-439]
- Fixed a weird mobile safari but about using a virtualization library with any form input from react-md. [issues-442]
- Added passive event listeners. [issues-382]
- Updated the Autocomplete to no longer require an automatic TextField re-focus after a suggestion has been selected.
[issues-428]
- Fixed the TextField placeholder to correctly gain the disabled color. [issues-447]
- Fixed the focus behavior of TextFields on mobile devices. [issues-434]
- Fixed the unneeded PropType warning when a "controlled" TextField is disabled. [issues-432]
- Fixed the PropType warning for Tabs. [issues-440]
- Fixed the multiline TextField requiring a flex container to display correctly. It will now display correctly if it is in
just a `display: block` or whatever. [issues-365]
- Fixed the TimePicker changing days when AM/PM was toggled. [issues-446]
- Fixed the TimePicker to remember the last selected time better. [issues-438]
- Fixed the TimePicker's ability to calculate time. [issues-359]
- Fixed multiple components that manually calculate size for container resize events instead of just window resize events.
  - ExpansionPanels and Tabs [issues-448]
  - Multiline TextFields [issues-365]
  - TablePagination [issues-415]

### v1.0.14 Released
This patch is mostly for keyboard accessibility updates so that the custom components interact the same way
as native form inputs.

##### Changelog

## April 2017
### Added Showcases

### v1.0.12 Released
This release is mostly about fixing some of the cross-browser support and weird issues in mobile safari.
In addition, an [examples folder](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/tree/master/examples) has been added
to hopefully help newer people get a react-md project started up.

In addition, I decided to move the ticket from `v1.1.0` to `v1.0.12` about the annoying delay when a menu/drawer/toast
is closed by a click action.

re-renders. [issues-300]

### v1.0.2 Released

## December 2016
### v1.0.0 Released!

This is the first prod-ready release of react-md. The library still isn't completely perfect, but I think it is close enough.

#### TL;DR
- Opt-in mixin component styles (or `@include react-md-everything;`)
- BEM Styles
- Grid System!
- Not fully backwards compatible.
- Accessibility focused.


##### Changelog
- Fixed the background color bug. [commit-49ce071]
- Fixed the pre-compiled bundles to actually reflect what my documentation said. The pre-compiled bundles
are now formatted as `PRIMARY-COLOR_SECONDARY_COLOR.min.css` instead of `PRIMARY-COLOR-SECONDARY-COLOR.MIN.CSS`.
- Created a mixin to create color class names. [commit-14e19f3]
- Fixed the injectINK HOC for keyboard _clicks_. [commit-59dff18]
- FileInput/FileUpload bugfixes. [commit-2c4e111]
- Updated the password text fields' styles for keyboard accessibility. [commit-807aa2a]
- Updated the TextFieldMessage to not shrink when in a block text field.
- Updated EditDialogColumn for accessibility. [commit-217c425]
- Updated typography to be able to opt out of utility class names. [commit-5c5eaa2]
- Updated SelectField keyboard accessibility. [commit-ffe270b]
- Updated tooltips to no longer rotate along with the `.md-collapser`s.
- Updated tooltips to be created through react components instead of my weird decision of creating it manually myself. [commit-75eb2e0]
- Rewrote SelectFieldColumn. [issues-170]
- Added the `getCurrentMedia` static method to the `NavigationDrawer` as well.
- Updated permanent drawers to no longer use the Portal.
- Updated the `Dialog` component to be able to be closed by pressing the escape key (only if not a `modal`). [commit-b742ed5]
- Updated the Date and Time pickers to have _some_ keyboard accessibility. This still isn't the ideal solution and will be changed in a
future release (maybe?) to actually allow inline date and time selection that will appear in dropdowns. [issues-173]
- Updated `FocusContainer` to be able to enable/disable the focus containment after being fully mounted.

### General Website Changes

SassDoc pages are now searchable and filterable while on that page itself. I found that using the main search
to attempt to keep finding variables on the same page was a bit annoying. The SassDoc page can now be quick navigated
by clicking the visible FAB and clicking any items in the new Drawer.


### v1.0.0-beta Released

This release fixed up a couple more bugs (listed below) and now the main focus will be figuring out if there are any
production-breaking bugs remaining.

##### Changelog
- Fixed the Avatar colors changing. [issues-161]
- Updated EditDialogColumn to interact correctly with keyboard focus and touch devices
- Fixed the `Dialog` to remove the prevent scroll className when unmounting
- Updated the `Drawer.getCurrentMedia` function to use the `Drawer.defaultProps` as the default value of the `props` parameter.
- Updated the `Drawer` to allow for a _persistent_ temporary Drawer on desktop devices.
- Fixed the `AccessibleFakeButton` to no longer use the space key as an enter keypress.
- Fixed a weird warning on inks if the `waitForInkTransition` prop was enabled and the click event eventually
unmounted the inked component.
- Updated the Menu to correctly remove the window click event on unmount.
- Added correct deprecation notices to the `SelectField` and fixed the keyboard accessibility when using a `SelectField.Positions.BELOW` position.
- Fixed the duplication of the `md-background--primary-hover` and `md-background--secondary-hover`.
- Fixed the duplication of `md-background--primary-hover` and renamed the second one to `md-background--secondary-hover`.
- Minor CSS Fixes



## November 2016
### General Website Changes

With the upcoming `v1.0.0` release, the website has been remade to allow quicker navigation, searching, and finding
related documentation.
- A [Theme Builder](/customization/theme-builder) has also been added that allows you to pick and
choose a theme on your website.
- Examples and Prop Types have been separated into different tabs to help separate content a bit more.
- Most SassDoc can be viewed with the related component in a new SassDoc tab.
- The main search now includes sass placeholders, variables, functions, and mixins that will either redirect you to
the correct SassDoc tab, or to the [SassDoc Page](/sassdoc).

### v1.0.0.alpha.4 Released

The main focus of this release was adding a `JumpToContent` link for the `NavigationDrawer` for keyboard accessibility. When you use
the `NavigationDrawer` (or specifically use the `JumpToContentLink` component), the first `tab` press on the page will show a link that
will allow a user to focus the main content of the page instead of having to go through every navigation item.

##### Changelog
- Fixed some color variables that I had mistyped...
- Fixed the spelling of `discreet -> discrete`
- Fixed the `Sliders` when using touch devices. [issues-144]
- Fixed the `YearPicker` after the name change from `initialYearsDisplayed` to `yearsDisplayed`. [issues-165]
- Added `onTabFocus` and `tabbedClassName` to the `AccessibleFakeButton`. [issues-160]

### v1.0.0.alpha.3 Released

This release was focused on having a more consistent naming convention. Boolean props are now `adjective` instead of
`isAdjective` and any prop that was `initiallyProp` was renamed `defaultProp` to match how React handles the base html
tag defaults. This also included some small bugfixes as well as updating the Portal component to stop using the undocumented
`CSSPropertyOperations` since it crashed in React 15.4.0.

The `SelectField` was also updated to no longer use the `TextField` component internally and behave more like the html select. [issues-144]

### v1.0.0.alpha.2 Released

Fixed the UMD build so that the `default` was not needed from the browser for `ReactMD.COMPONENT`.

### v1.0.0.alpha.1 Released

I found out I messed up the naming with a `.` instead of `-` so the future releases are messed up. Whoops. But this change basically
added the old v0.3.7 styles back into the `dist` folder for UMD.


### v1.0.0-alpha Released

Whew. This was a big change. This was a complete rewrite from nested CSS priority to using my first attempt at BEM (so it definitely
isn't perfect). The Sass also changed to an _opt-in_ `mixin` framework. Styles will no longer be included when importing the `scss` files.
The styles can be created by using `react-md-everything` or `react-md-COMPONENTs`. This allows for access to variables by one import instead
of having to specify multiple. Also, the dark theme was finally finished! Woo! Exciting! See the [upgrade guide](/discover-more/upgrade-guides/v1.0.0#now-vs-previous-versions)
for more information.

Some other under-the-hood changes are that as many components as possible use the `PureComponent` instead of the `PureRenderMixin`
with a `Component`. This release also changed my goals from this project. This project's goal is now to be a completely accessible React/Sass UI
framework for material design.

Finally, a material design [Grid System](/customization/grids) was created so positioning is even easier than before.
