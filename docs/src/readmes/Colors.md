# Color

[Material Design Color Guide](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html)

> Color in material design is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted
> environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights. Material takes cues
> from contemporary architecture, road signs, pavement marking tape, and
> athletic courts. Color should be unexpected and vibrant.

#### Using react-md's color palette
All colors are defined as `.md-COLOR_NAME-HUE` or if it is an accent color `.md-COLOR_NAME-a-HUE`.
So if you wanted to use purple as a primary color, you could reference it as:

```scss
background: $md-purple-500;
```

All the colors are displayed below.
