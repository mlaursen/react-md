# Sass Theme API

> !Info! Before reading this page, configure the default Sass variables through
> the [\_everything.scss](./how-to-customize#_everythingscss).

Use the Sass Theme API to use ReactMD custom property values or override custom
properties for parts of the app. The general setup is to define one variable,
one function and two mixins to work with the theme:

- `${group}-variables`
- `@mixin {group}-use-var($property, $name, $fallback: null)`
- `@mixin {group}-set-var($name, $new-value)`
- `@function {group}-get-var($name, $fallback: null)`

It is not required to use these functions and mixins, but they will ensure that
a valid `$name` has been provided and throw an error if the name does not
exist. This ensures there aren't any accidental typos during build-time and
provides a list of available custom property names.

> !Info! See the [$SASSDOC](contrast-color) function around how to
> automatically create an accessible text color for a background.

### The `variables` variable list

The `$variables` list can be used to view which items are configurable using
custom properties. It is used internally by the other functions and mixins to
validate and generate the custom property names.

This code example just prints out all the available theme variables.

```scss compile
@use "everything" as *;

:root {
  @each $var in $theme-variables {
    @include theme-set-var($var, inherit);
  }
}
```

### The `use-var` mixin

The `use-var` mixin should be used to apply the variable as a css property
value.

```scss compile
@use "everything" as *;

.example {
  @include theme-use-var(background-color);
  @include theme-use-var(color, text-primary-color);
  @include button-use-var(padding, text-horizontal-padding);
}
```

### The `set-var` mixin

The `set-var` mixin should be used to override the current value for a part of
the app.

```scss compile
@use "everything" as *;

.example {
  @include theme-set-var(background-color, surface-color);
  @include theme-set-var(primary-color, blue);
  @include theme-set-var(on-primary-color, contrast-color(blue));
  @include button-set-var(text-horizontal-padding, 8px);
}
```

### The `get-var` function

The `get-var` function should generally only be used if requiring the current
property in a
[calc() function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc), a
`set-var` value, or in a property shorthand since it just returns
`var(--rmd-{name})` or `var(--rmd-{name}, $fallback)`.

```scss compile
@use "everything" as *;

.example {
  padding: icon-get-var(spacing) button-get-var(text-horizontal-padding);
}
```

## Available Sass API
