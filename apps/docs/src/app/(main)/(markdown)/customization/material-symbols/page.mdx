# Material Symbols Setup

> !Success! Switching to Material Symbols is completely optional.

> !Info! This page assumes you have gone through the initial installation steps
> and would like to use [Material Symbols] throughout the app.

## Usage with [next.js]

## Usage with [vite]

A simple vite plugin can be installed and added to the `vite.config.ts` that
just searches all the included files for `MaterialSymbol` components and
extracts the material symbol name from the `name` prop.

```sh
npm install -D @react-md/vite-material-symbols-plugin
```

```diff
 import { resolve } from 'node:path'
 import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
 import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'
+import { materialSymbolsPlugin } from "@react-md/vite-material-symbols-plugin";

 // https://vite.dev/config/
 export default defineConfig({
-  plugins: [react()],
+  plugins: [react(), materialSymbolsPlugin()],
   resolve: {
     alias: {
       everything: resolve(import.meta.dirname, 'src/_everything.scss'),
     },
   },
 })
```

See the [configuration]($GITHUB/packages/vite-material-symbols-plugin/README.md#Configuration) for additional plugin options.
