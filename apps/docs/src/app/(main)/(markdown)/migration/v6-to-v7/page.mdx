# Migrate from v6 to v7

This release drops support for React < 19. To continue using React 18, stay on
the v6.x.x releases.

```sh
npm install react@19 react-dom@19 @react-md/core@7

# optional
npm install @react-md/material-icons@7

# optional
npm install -D @types/react@19 @types/react-dom@19
```

## Breaking Changes

As mentioned above, this release will only support React 19 going forward. The breaking changes include:

- `@react-md/core` components no longer use `forwardRef`
- The `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` packages might include type issues
  with the new `Ref` type changes and should be updated
