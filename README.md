react-md is a set of React components and sass files for implementing [Google's Material Design](https://material.google.com). The
[Documentation Website](http://react-md.mlaursen.com) can be used for viewing live examples, code samples, and general prop documentation.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save react react-dom react-md
```

There are also a few examples available within the [examples folder](examples/) to help get you started.

## Customizing the theme
The application should define a `primary` and `secondary` color. The `primary` color
should be chosen from one of the `'-500'` colors and the `secondary` should be one of
the `'a-'` colors.

The default color palette is defined as:

```scss
$md-primary-color: $md-indigo-500 !default;
$md-secondary-color: $md-pink-a-200 !default;
```

If you change these variables before the `react-md-everything` mixin is included, your entire
application will be styled with your new theme.

```scss
@import '~react-md/src/scss/react-md';

$md-primary-color: $md-teal-500;
$md-secondary-color: $md-lime-a-400;

@include react-md-everything;
```

See the [themes page](http://react-md.mlaursen.com/customization/themes) on the documentation website. There
is also a theme builder available to try mix and matching different colors.

### Styling Links
There are currently no styles applied to links by default for two reasons:
1. There aren't many guidelines for link styling in Material Design (or there weren't when I started this project)
2. Most of the time, links will mostly be handled by the `ListItem` component with a `react-router`'s `Link` component

If you would like some default link styles, you can copy/paste the following block to get some _reasonable_ defaults.

```scss
// These are the styles that are applied to the documentation site.
// If you want **ALL** links to have these styles, you can of course change it to be applied
// to all <a> tags
.link {
  color: $md-primary-color;
  display: inline-block;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color $md-transition-time;

  &:visited {
    color: get-swatch($md-primary-color, 200, true);
  }

  &:hover {
    color: get-color('text', $md-light-theme);
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

## Usage
Please see the list of [examples](examples/) for how you can get a project started off quickly with React and React MD.

### UMD Usage

        return React.createElement(ReactMD.Button, { label: 'Hello, World!', flat: true });
      }
    });

    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(MyAwesomeComponent), document.getElementById('app'));

```

## Known Bugs/Works in Progress/Future Changes

* Bottom sheets
* Steppers
* Eventually add Floating button transitions/morphing abilities. Ex: Speed Dial, Morph into toolbar/material/paper

## Contributing
Please see the [documentation site README](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/tree/master/docs#react-md-documentation)
for information about contributing using the documentation server. Otherwise, here is some information about only working
within `react-md`.

Right now I am using the `Ruby` version of `scss_lint` to lint scss files. This means that you will need to have Ruby installed
and the `sass-lint` gem.

```bash
$ gem install scss_lint
```

I have an issue (#274) open about switching over to the node port, but it hasn't really been worked on because I don't like
the little amount of features that have been ported over so far.

Otherwise this _should_ work on most systems with node >= 6.

### Minimal Setup
```bash
mlaursen @ ~/code/react-md
$ yarn
$ yarn build   # build the es and lib folders for docs scripts
$ cd docs
mlaursen @ ~/code/react-md/docs
$ yarn
$ cp .env.example .env
$ cd ..
mlaursen @ ~/code/react-md
$ yarn dev
```

### lint
This will run both the [lint:styles](#lintstyles) and [lint:scripts](#lintscripts) commands.

#### lint:fix
This will attempt to automatically fix any `eslint` errors that can be fixed.

#### lint:styles
As stated above, this will lint all the scss files within the `src/scss` directory. Unfortunately, this requires the Ruby gems
version of `scss-lint` to be installed to work because the node port isn't quite there yet for me. You can either
remove this temporarily from the build process or:

```bash
$ gem install scss_lint
```

#### lint:scripts
This will run `eslint` over all the files in the `src/js` folder.

### test
This command will run [test:tsc](#testtsc) followed by `jest`.

#### test:tsc
This will do a simple Typescript compliation test to make sure there aren't any syntax errors or
invalid types. There should probably be a better testing system put in place.

#### test:watch
This will just run `jest` in watch mode.

#### test:docs
This will just run `jest` in the docs folder.

#### test:docs:watch
This will just run `jest` in watch mode in the docs folder.

#### test:all
This will run tests for Typescript definitions, the base react-md repo, and the docs folder.

### tsd
This command will just copy all the Typescript definitions into the `lib` folder so that it can be used correctly
by Typescript users.

### css-bundles
This script makes 255 different scss files to be compiled for production use. This is automatically run before
[build](#build).

### dev
This will start up the documentation server in development mode as well as watching for changes within the base react-md library.
Please look at the [Getting Started](docs/README.md#getting-started) for some preliminary setup required.

### dev:minimal
This will start up the documentation server in development mode as well as watching for changes within the base react-md library.
The only difference is that the [docs:minimal](#docsminimal) command will be run instead of [docs](#docs)

### docs
This will start up the documentation server in development mode. For some more information about this command,
please see the [documentation server scripts](docs/README.md#Scripts).

### docs:minimal
This will start up the documentation server in development mode without rebuilding all the "databases" before startup.

### prebuild
This command is automatically run before [build](#build). It will basically remove all the old artifacts and compiled
files followed by linting the entire project.

### build
This command will do the full build of `react-md` before a release. It runs almost all of the other scripts in a specified
order so that the `es`, `lib`,`dist` folders are created and contain the correct files for release.

#### build:watch
This command will just build and watch changes for the CommonJS and ES6 modules distributables. This is just used behind
the scenes for the [dev](#dev) command for hot reloads.

#### build:cjs
This command will build the CommonJS distributables for react-md.

#### build:cjs:watch
This command will build the CommonJS distributables for react-md and recompile when changes occur.

#### build:es
This command will build the ES6 modules distributables for react-md.

#### build:es:watch
This command will build the ES6 modules distributables for react-md and recomple when changes occur.

#### build:umd
This command will create the UMD bundles for development and production use. It will also display the
size of the production UMD bundle in pretty format bytes.
