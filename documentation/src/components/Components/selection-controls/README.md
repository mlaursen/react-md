The `SelectionControl` component can be used to create either a `Checkbox`, `Radio`, or
`Switch` component. Unfortunately, if you want to use a `Radio` component, you will
manually need to control the `checked` state of the radio group. This is a component
`SelectionControlGroup` that can be used instead to help with this (and offer keyboard
accessibility).
