In addition, you should use an autoprefixer to\\nsupport multiple browsers. The sass files are currently prefix-free. If you are\\nfine with the default colors and typography, you can use the already compiled\\ncss files in `lib/react-md.css`\\n\\nIf you want to use the `DatePicker` or the `TimePicker` components, you must either\\ninclude the [Intl polyfill](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/) or implement\\nyour own if you need to support browsers that do not have it implemented.\\n[See caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=intl).\\n\\nThis project was developed with the [Roboto font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)\\nin mind.  Make sure to include the font library locally or from the cdn (or some font equivalent).\\n\\nFinally, some form of font icon library should be included. The\\ndefaults for this project are using [material-icons](https://design.google.com/icons/),\\nbut any font library can be used. (Hopefully). There are some mixins\\nfor helping pull these font libraries in from a cdn or locally hosted.\\n\\n> There are mixins for hosting the font libraries locally.\\n\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nThe first step is to use your favorite build tool/bundler.\\n\\n* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)\\n* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)\\n* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)\\n* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)\\n* whatever\\n\\nAfterwards include `./node_modules/react-md/src/scss/react-md.scss` in some form for the sass files\\nand make sure to use an autoprefixer.\\n\\nFinally, use the components as normal.\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\n```js\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\\n\\nimport { Card, CardTitle, CardText } from 'react-md/lib/Cards';\\n\\nconst HelloWorld = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"md-card-list\\\">\\n      <Card>\\n        <CardTitle title=\\\"Hello, World!\\\" />\\n        <CardText>Lorem ipsum... pretend more...</CardText>\\n      </Card>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('app'));\\n```\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./src/app/GettingStarted/README.md\n ** module id = 591\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"import React from 'react';\\n\\nimport Toolbar, { ActionArea } from 'react-md/lib/Toolbars';\\nimport { IconButton } from 'react-md/lib/Buttons';\\nimport { Tabs, Tab } from 'react-md/lib/Tabs';\\nimport { numstr } from '../utils';\\nimport Paper from 'react-md/lib/Papers';\\n\\nconst ToolbarWithTabs = ({ centered = false, scrollable = false, fixedWidth = false }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <Paper>\\n      <Toolbar\\n        primary\\n        actionLeft={<IconButton className=\\\"menu-btn\\\">menu</IconButton>}\\n        title=\\\"Page title\\\"\\n        actionsRight={(\\n          <ActionArea>\\n            <IconButton>search</IconButton>\\n            <IconButton>more_vert</IconButton>\\n          </ActionArea>\\n        )}\\n        >\\n        <Tabs primary centered={centered} scrollable={scrollable} fixedWidth={fixedWidth}>\\n          {Array.apply(null, new Array(scrollable ? 9 : 3)).map((_, i) => (\\n          <Tab\\n            key={i}\\n            label={`Item ${numstr[i]}`}\\n            >\\n            <div style={{ minHeight: '80px', background: '#fafafa' }} />\\n          </Tab>\\n          ))}\\n        </Tabs>\\n      </Toolbar>\\n    </Paper>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nexport default ToolbarWithTabs;\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./src/app/ToolbarWithTabs/ToolbarWithTabs.jsx\n ** module id = 592\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"import React from 'react';\\nimport Divider from 'react-md/lib/Dividers';\\nimport { List, ListItem, ListSubheader } from 'react-md/lib/Lists';\\n\\nimport { randomAvatars } from '../utils';\\n\\nconst MDASH = ' \\\\u2014 ';\\nconst avatars = randomAvatars(4);\\n\\nconst MessageList = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <List>\\n      <ListSubheader primaryText=\\\"Today\\\" />\\n      <ListItem\\n        primaryText=\\\"Brunch this weekend?\\\"\\n        secondaryText={(\\n          <span>\\n            <span>Ali Connors</span>\\n            {MDASH}\\n            <span className=\\\"md-secondary-text\\\">I'll be in your neighborhood at some point</span>\\n          </span>\\n        )}\\n        leftAvatar={avatars[0]}\\n      />\\n      <Divider inset />\\n      <ListItem\\n        primaryText={(\\n          <span>\\n            <span>Summer BBQ</span>\\n            <span className=\\\"md-secondary-text\\\">{' 4 '}</span>\\n          </span>\\n        )}\\n        secondaryText={(\\n          <span>\\n            <span>to Alex, Scott, Jennifer</span>\\n            {MDASH}\\n            <span className=\\\"md-secondary-text\\\">Wish I could read more text</span>\\n          </span>\\n        )}\\n        leftAvatar={avatars[1]}\\n      />\\n      <Divider inset />\\n      <ListItem\\n        primaryText=\\\"Oui Oui\\\"\\n        secondaryText={(\\n          <span>\\n            <span>Sandra Adams</span>\\n            {MDASH}\\n            <span className=\\\"md-secondary-text\\\">Do you have Paris recorded</span>\\n          </span>\\n        )}\\n        leftAvatar={avatars[2]}\\n      />\\n      <Divider inset />\\n      <ListItem\\n        primaryText=\\\"Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet\\\"\\n        secondaryText=\\\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
