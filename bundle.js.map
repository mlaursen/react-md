Defaults to 6 (the -500 suffix).\\n`secondary` - boolean if this is an accent color, so uses a range of 1-4.\\n\\n### Theming\\n\\nThe initial theme is the one you see for this documentation website.\\n\\n```scss\\n$md-primary-color: indigo !default;\\n$md-secondary-color: pink !default;\\n$md-secondary-hue: 2 !default;\\n```\\n\\nYou can override these variables to style your app very quickly.\\n\\nIf you would like more control, there are mixins with the prefix `md-theme-` that you can use\\nto specifically style one component. The default theme is created from the\\n[\\\\_themes.scss](../master/src/scss/_theme.scss).\\n\\nSome components are joined with the their parent class, while others are not.\\n\\n#### Default theme\\n\\n```scss\\n$primary: get-md-color($md-primary-color);\\n$secondary: get-md-color($md-secondary-color, $md-secondary-color-hue, true);\\n$text: $white-base;\\n$disabled-text: rgba($text, .7);\\n\\n@include md-theme-text-fields($primary);\\n@include md-theme-snackbars();\\n@include md-theme-date-pickers($primary, get-md-color($md-primary-color, 5));\\n@include md-theme-select-fields($primary);\\n\\n.md-primary {\\n  @include md-theme-toolbars($primary, $white-base);\\n  @include md-theme-buttons($primary);\\n  @include md-theme-tabs($primary, $secondary, $text, $disabled-text);\\n}\\n\\n.md-secondary {\\n  @include md-theme-buttons($secondary);\\n  $secondary: get-md-color($md-secondary-color);\\n  @include md-theme-toolbars($secondary, $white-base);\\n  @include md-theme-tabs($secondary, $primary, $text, $disabled-text);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Media Queries\\n\\nThe sass is currently set up to have very basic media queries to figure out if it is\\nmobile or desktop. The current breakpoint is just at `600px`.\\n\\nIf there is a component that has different mobile/desktop versions, there is a mixin in the form\\nof `md-component-name-desktop` or `md-component-name-mobile` that you can use.\\n\\n#### Default media queries\\n\\n```scss\\n@media only screen and (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 599px) {\\n  @include md-date-picker-mobile();\\n  @include md-select-field-mobile();\\n  @include md-snackbar-mobile();\\n  @include md-tab-mobile();\\n  @include md-text-field-mobile();\\n  @include md-toolbar-mobile();\\n}\\n\\n@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {\\n  @include md-date-picker-desktop();\\n  @include md-select-field-desktop();\\n  @include md-snackbar-desktop();\\n  @include md-tab-desktop();\\n  @include md-text-field-desktop();\\n  @include md-toolbar-desktop();\\n}\\n```\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./src/app/Customization/README.md\n ** module id = 557\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"### Installation\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install -S react \\\\\\n                 react-dom \\\\\\n                 react-addons-pure-render-mixin \\\\\\n                 react-addons-transition-group \\\\\\n                 react-addons-css-transition-group \\\\\\n                 react-md\\n```\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nTo use this libarary, it is recommended to have previous experience using React\\ncomponents along with sass/css. In addition, you should use an autoprefixer to\\nsupport multiple browsers. The sass files are currently prefix-free. If you are\\nfine with the default colors and typography, you can use the already compiled\\ncss files in `lib/react-md.css`\\n\\nIf you want to use the `DatePicker` or the `TimePicker` components, you must either\\ninclude the [Intl polyfill](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/) or implement\\nyour own if you need to support browsers that do not have it implemented.\\n[See caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=intl).\\n\\nThis project was developed with the [Roboto font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)\\nin mind.  Make sure to include the font library locally or from the cdn (or some font equivalent).\\n\\nFinally, some form of font icon library should be included. The\\ndefaults for this project are using [material-icons](https://design.google.com/icons/),\\nbut any font library can be used. (Hopefully). There are some mixins\\nfor helping pull these font libraries in from a cdn or locally hosted.\\n\\n> There are mixins for hosting the font libraries locally.\\n\\n\\n### Usage\\n\\nThe first step is to use your favorite build tool/bundler.\\n\\n* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)\\n* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)\\n* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)\\n* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)\\n* whatever\\n\\nAfterwards include `./node_modules/react-md/src/scss/react-md.scss` in some form for the sass files\\nand make sure to use an autoprefixer.\\n\\nFinally, use the components as normal.\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\n```js\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\\n\\nimport { Card, CardTitle, CardText } from 'react-md/Cards';\\n\\nconst HelloWorld = () => {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"md-card-list\\\">\\n      <Card>\\n        <CardTitle title=\\\"Hello, World!\\\" />\\n        <CardText>Lorem ipsum... pretend more...</CardText>\\n
