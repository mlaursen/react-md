The `NavigationDrawer` component is normally used for a full-page layout. It
will combine the `Toolbar` and `Drawer` components in a nice way as well as
displaying your main content. In addition, when a `full-height` drawer type is
used, it will add a keyboard-only tabbable link that will allow keyboard users
to skip the entire navigation process and start looking at the main content.

### NavigationDrawer vs Drawer/Toolbar

The `NavigationDrawer` component is just a simple way to combine a main fixed
`Toolbar` and a `Drawer` component on the page. It will handle any of the
positioning and offsets required for you. It will definitely be less flexible
than the `Drawer/Toolbar` manual combo yourself.
