This basically\ncreates a main flex container `.md-grid` that will style cells\nwith appropriate margins and widths.\n\nThe following classes will be created:\n\n`.md-grid` - The main flex container. You should use this along with the `.md-cell` to get\nthe correct gutter and margins for a material desing page.\n\n`.md-grid--no-spacing` - An optional class name to use with the `.md-grid`. When they are used\ntogether, all the margins and spacings will be removed from the grid.\n\n`.md-cell` - The main container for a column or cell in the grid. If this is used alone, the default\nbehavior is to display 1 cell per row on mobile devices, 2 cells per row on tablets, and 3 cells per row\non desktop / larger screens. For more fine tuning, it can be used along with one of the following.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER` - This is will allow a cell to span this many columns on all media sizes. When the `NUMBER`\nis greater than the number of columns allowed for a media device, it will span the entire row. This basically means\nthat if you are using the base configuration options and following the material design specs, mobile devices only\nallow 4 columns per row, tablets 8 per row, and desktops 12. So specifying `.md-cell .md-cell--6` would span an\nentire row on mobile devices, 3/4 of a row on tablets, and 1/2 of a row on desktops.\n\n`md-cell--order-NUMBER` - This is an optional class name you can apply if you want this item to appear in a different\norder on the grid.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset` - This will offset the cell by the given number of columns. If the `number` is greater\nthan the maximum amount of columsn allowed for the device's screen size, an entire row will be blank.\n\n`.md-cell--right` - This simply applies `margin-left: auto` to a cell. This is basically the same as applying\n`float: right` in a row.\n\n`.md-cell--top` - This aligns the cell to the top of a row.\n\n`.md-cell--middle` - This aligns the cell to the middle of a row.\n\n`.md-cell--bottom` - This aligns the cell to the bottom of a row.\n\n`.md-cell--stretch` - This aligns the cell to stretch the entire height of a row. This is the default behavior.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-phone` - This will set the cell's size only for mobile devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-tablet` - This will set the cell's size only for tablet devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-desktop` - This will set the cell's size only for desktop / large screens.\n\n`.md-cell--order-NUMBER-phone` - This will set the cell's order only for mobile devices.\n\n`.md-cell--order-NUMBER-tablet` - This will set the cell's order only for tablet devices.\n\n`.md-cell--order-NUMBER-desktop` - This will set the cell's order only for desktop / large screens.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset-phone` - This will offset the cell's position only for mobile devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset-tablet` - This will offset the cell's position for tablet devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset-desktop` - This will offset the cell's position for desktop / large screens.\n\n","commentRange":{"start":78,"end":139},"context":{"type":"mixin","name":"react-md-grid","code":"\n  .md-grid {\n    align-items: stretch;\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: row wrap;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n\n    &.md-grid--no-spacing {\n      padding: 0;\n\n      > .md-cell {\n        margin: 0;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--top {\n    align-self: flex-start;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--middle {\n    align-self: center;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--bottom {\n    align-self: flex-end;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--stretch {\n    align-self: stretch;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--right {\n    @extend %md-cell--right;\n  }\n\n  @if $include-media {\n    @include react-md-grid-media;\n  }\n","line":{"start":140,"end":179}},"example":[{"type":"scss","code":"@include react-md-grid;","description":"Example Usage SCSS"}],"parameter":[{"type":"Boolean","name":"include-media","default":"$md-media-included","description":"Boolean if the media queries should be included as well.\n    If this is false, you will manually need to call the media mixins to get any useful grid."}],"group":["grid"],"access":"public","require":[{"type":"mixin","name":"react-md-grid-media"}],"file":{"path":"_grid.scss","name":"_grid.scss"},"usedBy":[{"description":"Includes every component, transition, and typography including their\nmedia queries if the `$md-media-included` variable is `true`.

This basically\ncreates a main flex container `.md-grid` that will style cells\nwith appropriate margins and widths.\n\nThe following classes will be created:\n\n`.md-grid` - The main flex container. You should use this along with the `.md-cell` to get\nthe correct gutter and margins for a material desing page.\n\n`.md-grid--no-spacing` - An optional class name to use with the `.md-grid`. When they are used\ntogether, all the margins and spacings will be removed from the grid.\n\n`.md-cell` - The main container for a column or cell in the grid. If this is used alone, the default\nbehavior is to display 1 cell per row on mobile devices, 2 cells per row on tablets, and 3 cells per row\non desktop / larger screens. For more fine tuning, it can be used along with one of the following.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER` - This is will allow a cell to span this many columns on all media sizes. When the `NUMBER`\nis greater than the number of columns allowed for a media device, it will span the entire row. This basically means\nthat if you are using the base configuration options and following the material design specs, mobile devices only\nallow 4 columns per row, tablets 8 per row, and desktops 12. So specifying `.md-cell .md-cell--6` would span an\nentire row on mobile devices, 3/4 of a row on tablets, and 1/2 of a row on desktops.\n\n`md-cell--order-NUMBER` - This is an optional class name you can apply if you want this item to appear in a different\norder on the grid.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset` - This will offset the cell by the given number of columns. If the `number` is greater\nthan the maximum amount of columsn allowed for the device's screen size, an entire row will be blank.\n\n`.md-cell--right` - This simply applies `margin-left: auto` to a cell. This is basically the same as applying\n`float: right` in a row.\n\n`.md-cell--top` - This aligns the cell to the top of a row.\n\n`.md-cell--middle` - This aligns the cell to the middle of a row.\n\n`.md-cell--bottom` - This aligns the cell to the bottom of a row.\n\n`.md-cell--stretch` - This aligns the cell to stretch the entire height of a row. This is the default behavior.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-phone` - This will set the cell's size only for mobile devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-tablet` - This will set the cell's size only for tablet devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-desktop` - This will set the cell's size only for desktop / large screens.\n\n`.md-cell--order-NUMBER-phone` - This will set the cell's order only for mobile devices.\n\n`.md-cell--order-NUMBER-tablet` - This will set the cell's order only for tablet devices.\n\n`.md-cell--order-NUMBER-desktop` - This will set the cell's order only for desktop / large screens.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset-phone` - This will offset the cell's position only for mobile devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset-tablet` - This will offset the cell's position for tablet devices.\n\n`.md-cell--NUMBER-offset-desktop` - This will offset the cell's position for desktop / large screens.\n\n","context":{"type":"mixin","name":"react-md-grid","code":"\n  .md-grid {\n    align-items: stretch;\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: row wrap;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n\n    &.md-grid--no-spacing {\n      padding: 0;\n\n      > .md-cell {\n        margin: 0;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--top {\n    align-self: flex-start;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--middle {\n    align-self: center;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--bottom {\n    align-self: flex-end;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--stretch {\n    align-self: stretch;\n  }\n\n  .md-cell--right {\n    @extend %md-cell--right;\n  }\n\n  @if $include-media {\n    @include react-md-grid-media;\n  }\n","line":{"start":140,"end":179}}}]}]}
