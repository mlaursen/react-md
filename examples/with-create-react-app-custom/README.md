# react-mdm with-create-react-app-custom
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and [custom-react-scripts](https://github.com/kitze/custom-react-scripts).

This example project just followed the above steps and added the webfontloader and react-md.

See the `_globals.scss`, `index.scss`, and `App.scss` for additional style changes.
