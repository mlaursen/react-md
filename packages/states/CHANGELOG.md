## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

This package is kind of new for the v2 release but the closest thing within v1
is the `injectInk` and "ink" effects. The ink effect has been renamed to a
ripple effect and there are some other additional goodies included now.

This release has one of the most exciting new features that has been requested a
lot by designers: **focus states are only applied when the user is interacting
with a keyboard**. If you are unfamiliar with this, clicking a focusable element
in the DOM actually triggers a `focus` event on that element as well. This means
that any `:focus` styles will be applied which is usually not what we want.

The v2 release has introduced three interaction modes to help prevent this sort
of thing where styles can be added only for `touch`, `mouse`, or `keyboard`.
Super exciting stuff; I know.

### New Features / Behavior

- the material design ripple effect can now be disabled with React context
- added a new optional "pressed" state that can be used instead of ripples for a
  simpler interaction state when being clicked/touched
- able to apply styles based on the current user interaction mode with simple
  mixins
- adds a custom focus box shadow while interacting in keyboard mode to improve
  the visibility of the current focused item (can be opted-out, but not
  recommended for accessibility)

### Breaking Changes

- `injectInk` higher order component no longer exists with no alternative
- the material design ripple has no "pulsing" effect anymore (this was defaulted
  to `false` in v1 anyways)

#### New SCSS Variables, Functions, and Mixins

  be used when a user clicks or touches an interactable element such as buttons

  shadow should be used while an element is focused in keyboard mode

- removed `$md-ink-pulse-time`, `$md-ink-expanded-scale`, and
  `$md-ink-border-radius` since it's no longer configurable
- removed `@mixin react-md-theme-inks` since it is now done with the new theming
  API and mixins
