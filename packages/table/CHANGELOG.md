## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

This release focused on updating the tables to be more customizable, easier to
style, and better for accessibility with sticky cells. To create a table within
v2, you'll have access to the following components:

- `TableContainer`
- `Table`
- `TableHeader`
- `TableBody`
- `TableFooter`
- `TableRow`
- `TableCell`
- `Caption`
- `TableCheckbox`

### New Features / Behavior

- the table components no longer use the `React.cloneElement` API so "gotchas"
  with custom wrappers should no longer happen
- the `DataTable` component was removed and separated into `TableContainer` and
  `Table` components for additional customization
- the sticky table headers and footers now use `position: sticky` instead of the
  ugly multiple div/table wrapper behavior
- now supports sticky cells within the `<tbody>` that can be fixed to the right
  or left
- should now be able to render any popout component (like menus and dialogs)
  without some weird hacks behind the scenes
- added a configurable `dense` spec for tables
- tables no longer need to be full width and can be rendered inline with other
  content
- added additional table configuration props/API to change the built-in styles
- the table styles should be easier to configure since all nesting and
  additional precedence have been removed with the re-write
- fixed the accessibility for the sortable header cells so that they are
  keyboard focusable as well as providing the correct `aria-sort` and `scope`

### Breaking Changes

- no longer supports automatically rendering checkboxes in each row since it
  never really worked as expected anyways
- removed the `DropdownMenuColumn`, `SelectFieldColumn`, `EditDialogColumn`,
  `MenuButtonColumn` components since they are no longer required
- removed the `TablePagination` and `TableCardHeader` components since they are
  not supported anymore. this might be added in for a later release
- `TableColumn` has been reworked and renamed to `TableCell`
- the `TableCell` no longer supports tooltips by default but can be quickly
  added back with the `Tooltipped` component from [@react-md/tooltip]

#### New SCSS Variables, Functions, and Mixins

- `$rmd-table-cell-vertical-padding: 0.375rem !default` - the amount of padding
  to apply to the top or bottom of each cell when the vertical alignment is set
  to `"top"` or `"bottom"`
- `$rmd-table-cell-sticky-position: 0 !default` - The default position for a
  sticky cell that appears within the `<tbody>` (this will be used as the `left`
  value)
- `$rmd-table-footer-sticky-position: 0 !default` - The default position for a
  sticky cell that appears within the `<tfoot>` (this will be used as the
  `bottom` value)
- `$rmd-table-cell-sticky-z-index: 2 !default` - The z-index to use for all
  sticky cells within a table
- `$rmd-table-cell-dense-height: 2rem !default` - The height to use for each
  cell when the dense spec is enabled
- `$rmd-table-cell-color: rmd-theme-var(text-primary-on-background) !default` -
  The text color to use for cells within the `<tbody>`
- `$rmd-table-checkbox-padding: 0.5rem !default` - The amount of padding to
  apply to a `TableCheckbox`
- `@function rmd-table-theme` - gets one of the theme values and validates that
  the theme name is valid
- `@function rmd-table-theme-var` - gets one of the theme values as a css
  variable with a fallback value and validates that the theme name is valid
- `@mixin rmd-table-theme` - applies one of the theme values to a css property
  as a css variable
- `@mixin rmd-table-theme-update-var` - updates one of the theme values as a css
  variable

#### Renamed SCSS Variables, Functions, and Mixins

- renamed `$md-data-table-padding` to `$rmd-table-cell-horizontal-padding` and
  changed the default value from `24px` to `1rem`
- renamed `$md-data-table-header-height` to `$rmd-table-header-cell-height` and
  changed the default value from `56px` to `3.5rem`
- renamed `$md-data-table-column-height` to `$rmd-table-cell-height` and changed
  the default value from `48px` to `3.25rem`
- renamed `$md-data-table-light-theme-hover-color` and
  `$md-data-table-dark-theme-hover-color` into a single
  `$rmd-table-row-hover-color` and changed the default value to
  `rgba($rmd-black-base, 0.12)`
- renamed `$md-data-table-light-theme-selected-color` and
  `$md-data-table-dark-theme-selected-color` into a single
  `$rmd-table-row-selected-color` that now defaults to
  `rmd-states-theme-var(selected-color)`

#### Removed SCSS Variables, Placeholders, and Mixins

- removed `$md-data-table-include-plain` and
  `$md-data-table-plain-column-height` since there is no concept of a "data
  table" versus a "plain table"
- removed `$md-data-table-include-checkboxes` since it is no longer supported
  out of the box
- removed `$md-data-table-include-edit-dialog`, `$md-edit-dialog-min-width`,
  `$md-edit-dialog-width`, `$md-edit-dialog-label-width`,
  `$md-edit-dialog-label-padding`, `$md-edit-dialog-padding`,
  `$md-edit-dialog-padding-bottom`, and
  `$md-data-table-edit-dialog-mobile-right` since edit dialogs are no longer
  supported out of the box (can be re-implemented with the `FixedDialog` and
  `TextField` components)
- removed `$md-data-table-include-select-fields` since this hacky workaround is
  no longer needed in v2

  included for now

  `$md-data-table-pagination-mobile-shrinking`, and

- removed `$md-data-table-selected-over-hover` since it's no longer needed
- removed `$md-data-table-fixed-include-headers`,
  `$md-data-table-fixed-include-footers`, and
  `$md-data-table-fixed-use-view-height` since the
  `@mixin react-md-make-fixed-table` no longer exists and isn't required for
  fixed tables
- removed `$md-data-table-min-padding` since I don't remember what it was really
  supposed to accomplish and doesn't exist in v2
- removed `$md-data-table-content-font-size` and
  `$md-data-table-header-font-size` since they are no longer configurable with
  SCSS variables
- removed `$md-data-table-border-size` since it is now configurable with the
  [@react-md/divider] package
- removed `$md-data-table-fixed-wrapper-min-width` since there is no longer a
  table wrapper
- removed `%md-table-column--plain` placeholder since it's no longer used
- removed `@mixin react-md-theme-data-tables` since it is now handled with the
  new theming API
