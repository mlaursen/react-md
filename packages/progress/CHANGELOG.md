## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

The progress package probably went through the least amount of changes for the
v2 release. The main changes involved were switching to `<span>`s instead of
`<div>`s so they can be rendered within buttons and a few API changes to
hopefully be easier to work with.

### New Features / Behavior

- new theme variables and mixins to dynamically change the color and size of the
  progress bars
- introduced a new util `getProgressA11y` that can be used to link a progress
  bar to another element that is loading
- the `LinearProgress` bar can now also be rendered vertically instead of
  horizontal only
- the `CircularProgress`'s size is now configurable with CSS instead of a
  `scale` prop

### Breaking Changes

- dropped support for the `progressStyle` function but might be added back later
- dropped support for updating the `CircularProgress`'s size with component
  props since it's easier to style in CSS now

#### New SCSS Variables, Functions, and Mixins

- `$rmd-progress-color: $rmd-theme-primary !default` - A new variable to
  configure the progress color
- `$rmd-progress-background-color: rmd-theme-get-swatch($rmd-theme-primary, 300, false, rgba($rmd-theme-primary, 0.4), rmd-progress-background-color) !default` -
  The background color to use for the incomplete progress part of the linear
  progress bar
- `$rmd-linear-progress-styles` - A Map that gets converted into the linear
  progress animation
- `$rmd-linear-progress-short-styles` - A Map that gets converted into the
  linear progress shorter animation
- `$rmd-linear-progress-reverse-styles` - A Map that gets converted into the
  reversed linear progress animation
- `$rmd-linear-progress-reverse-short-styles` - A Map that gets converted into

  circular progress. **This is doubled the default size in v1.**
- `$rmd-circular-progress-stroke-width: 6 !default` - The stroke width for the
  circular progress SVG that used to be a prop
- `$rmd-circular-progress-start-offset: $rmd-circular-progress-dasharray !default` -
  The starting dashoffset for the circular progress animation
- `$rmd-circular-progress-end-offset: $rmd-circular-progress-dasharray / 4 !default` -
  The ending dashoffset for the circular progress animation
- `$rmd-circular-progress-rotate-styles` - A Map that gets converted into the
  circular progress rotation animation
- `$rmd-cicular-progress-dash-styles` - A Map that gets converted into the
  circular progress stroke-dashoffset animation while rotating
- `@function rmd-progress-theme` - gets one of the theme values and validates
  that the theme name is valid
- `@function rmd-progress-theme-var` - gets one of the theme values as a css
  variable with a fallback value and validates that the theme name is valid
- `@mixin rmd-progress-theme` - applies one of the theme values to a css
  property as a css variable
- `@mixin rmd-progress-theme-update-var` - updates one of the theme values as a
  css variable

#### Renamed SCSS Variables, Functions, and Mixins

- renamed `$md-progress-include-linear` to `$rmd-progress-include-linear`
- renamed `$md-progress-include-circular` to `$rmd-progress-include-circular`
- renamed `$md-linear-progress-height` to `$rmd-linear-progress-size` and
  changed the default value from `3px` to `0.25rem`
- renamed `$md-progress-duration` to `$rmd-linear-progress-transition-duration`
  and `$rmd-circular-progress-transition-duration` to allow the transitions to
  be separate times if desired. Kept the same default value of `2.4s`
- renamed `$md-linear-progress-delay` to
  `$rmd-linear-progress-short-animation-delay` and changed the default value
  from `1.15s` to `0.75s`
- renamed `$md-circular-progress-stroke-dasharray` to
  `$rmd-cirular-progress-dasharray` and changed the default value from `187px`
  to `187`

#### Removed SCSS Variables and Mixins

- removed `$md-linear-progress-swatch` and `$md-linear-progress-fallback-color`
  since they are no longer used and already has sensible defaults with the new
  `rmd-theme-get-swatch` function
- removed `$md-progress-margin` since margin is no longer automatically applied
  to the progress components
- removed the `@mixin react-md-theme-progress-circular`,
  `@mixin react-md-theme-progress-linear`, and `@mixin react-md-theme-progress`
  since there is a new theming API
