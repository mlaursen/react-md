## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

The chip package was completely re-written with Typescript and additional
theming support for the v2 release.

### New Behavior and Features

- supports a new `"outline"` theme along with the old `"solid"` theme
- supports rendering as a checkbox/radio component with a new `selected` state
  that includes a customizable icon
- supports rendering a `CircularProgress` bar as the `leftIcon`
- automatically updates padding and spacing for right-to-left languages
- supports updating all the sizing, spacing, and colors through css variables
  with the new theme functions and mixins
- renders as a [toggle button](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button)

- everything related to styling and props for the chip
- no longer supports a dense spec out of the box since they are already pretty
  dense

  chips
