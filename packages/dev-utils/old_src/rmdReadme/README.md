## Installation

react-md has been updated to use
[scoped packages](https://react-md.dev/guides/scoped-packages) starting with the
v2 release to help slowly transition to the new components and API. If you do
not need to slowly transition over this package can be used instead which is a
convenience package for exporting all the functionality from a single entry
point.

```sh
npm install --save react-md
```

or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add react-md
```

For convenience, here is a list of all the included react-md scoped packages and
a link to their demo documentation page:
