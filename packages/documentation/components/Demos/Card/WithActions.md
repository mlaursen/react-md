Since a user normally interacts with the content of a card, you can also apply
actions using the `CardActions` component. This is normally used alongside the
`Button` component from #button as the `CardActions` just applies some simple
padding and `flex` behavior.

This example will also show how cards can be "raiseable" so that when a desktop
user can hover the card to raise the elevation.
