A `RangeSlider` is another implementation of a slider that allows the user to
select a min and max value from a specific range of numbers. Like the `Slider`,
this component is fully controlled and requires the use of the `useRangeSlider`
hook to provide the `value` and "controls" to updating the `value`. The hook
allows for customizing the `min`, `max`, and `step` options.

The `RangeSlider` also requires providing accessible labels for each "thumb" by
one of the available label props.

Check out the examples below to see how to use the `useRangeSlider` hook and a
few of the styling props available for the `RangeSlider`.
