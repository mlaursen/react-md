Title: react-md 2.0.0

Date: 06/15/2020

Read More: v2-release

Summary:

The v2 release is a complete re-write of react-md to address the majority of
problems encountered while using v1. Unfortunately, this took a **lot** longer
than I had hoped since I ended up using this project to learn
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as well as the new
[React hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Even though there
are some missing components from v1, I think the new functionality outweighs it
and the components are scoped for a later release.

The 2.0.0 release of react-md features:

- Rewrite to Typescript
- New Behavior for Determining the Current Application Size
- New Theme API
- New Utility SCSS Functions and Mixins
- SCSS Variables and Default Values in JavaScript
- Automatic Color fixes for Accessible Contrast Ratios
- Improved Typography and CSS Reset
- Improved User Interaction States
- Improved Accessibility and Keyboard Movement
- Right to left Language Support
- Convenience Configuration and Context Provider Components
- Around 50 new Components and 40 hooks
- All Material Icons Available as Components
- Scoped Packages
- New Documentation Site
