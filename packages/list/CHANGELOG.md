## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

This package has a lot of changes from the v1 API that should hopefully make it
easier to use. There are also new components to help with styling and
positioning of addons that can be used without a `ListItem`/`List` component.

### New Behavior and Features

- all components now correctly forward the `ref` to the DOM element
- introduced a new `dense` spec instead of using `mobile`/`desktop` which is
  enabled by default once desktop media matches but can be disabled by setting
  `$rmd-utils-auto-dense: false`
- added a `ListItemChildren` component that allows you to get all the styling of
  the children within a `ListItem` without requiring the use of the `ListItem`
- added a `ListItemAddon` component that can be used to add spacing between the
  `children` and an addon with the `ListItem` spacing styles
- added a `SimpleListItem` component if you don't want to create a clickable
  `ListItem` but honestly shouldn't be used too much due to how screen readers
  read `<li>` elements
- added a `ListItemText` component that allows you to render the primary and
  optional secondary text that is normally stacked
- added a `ListItemLink` component that allows you to render a link with the
  `ListItem` styles
- the `ListItem` no longer renders as an `AccessibleFakeButton` and has a
  simpler HTML structure
- the `ListItem` now supports rendering images with two different sizes
- the `ListItem` now renders children to the left and/or right of the
  text/children with the new `leftAddon`, `leftAddonType`, `rightAddon`, and
  `rightAddonType` props
- the `ListItem` now supports rendering the addons in different vertical
  positions by default with the `leftAddonPosition` and `rightAddonPosition`
  props
- the `ListItem` now supports rendering the `children` as the `primaryText` when
  enabling the `textChildren` prop
- added built-in support for right-to-left languages with the list item addons
- the `Subheader` component was renamed to `ListSubheader`
- the `ListSubheader` now renders `children` instead of using a `primaryText`
  prop
- updated all of the sizing and padding values of the list item to be
  configurable with CSS variables along with the new theming API available
  through mixins

### Breaking Changes

- removed the `ListItemControl` component and built-in functionality for
  rendering checkbox, radio, or switch elements within a `ListItem`
- the `List` component renamed the `inline` prop to `horizontal`
- the `List` component now renders with `role="none"` by default
- the `ListSubheader` component no longer supports styling text with the primary
  theme color out of the box
- removed the ability to render nested list items but added a new
  `@react-md/tree` to handle those use-cases
- basically everything about the `ListItem` component is a breaking change
