```

## v2.0.0

The v2 release is a complete re-write of react-md to address the majority of
problems encountered while using v1. Unfortunately, this took a **lot** longer
than I had hoped since I ended up using this project to learn [Typescript] as
well as the new [React hooks API]. Even though there are some missing components
from v1, I think the new functionality outweighs it and the components are
scoped for a later release.

##### Missing Components and Functionality from v1 <!-- no-margin-bottom -->

Before starting the migration to v2, I highly recommend reviewing the [Working
with v1] guide and reviewing the following missing functionality:

- **dropped full support for IE 11** and mostly targeting evergreen browsers for
  the new dynamic themes
- some styling props have been removed since the new component API should
  hopefully eliminate the need for those props. (These props were normally
  `get*Style`, `get*ClassName`, etc)
- controlling the visibility and value of some components has been removed since
  I struggled figuring out a good way to handle controlled/uncontrolled
  components and hooks. I definitely plan on adding support for this
  functionality back in.
- the `BottomNavigation` component has not been added to the initial v2 release.
  This component might be added at a later time, but the new #app-bar package
  should be able to solve a decent amount of use cases.
- the `DatePicker` and `TimePicker` components have not been added to the
  initial v2 release. These two components will definitely be added in a later
  release, but require a lot more time to implement since **dates are hard** and
  I want to create all the sub-components in a reusable and exportable way for
  additional customization.
- removed the `FileUpload` component since it didn't feel extremely useful since
  it didn't actually upload a file to a server
- the `mini` variants for the `Drawer`/`NavigationDrawer` components have not
  yet been implemented in the new `Layout` component.
- removed the `MenuTab` component due to never really working correctly and the
  new #tabs package should allow for a much better user experience and
  customization.
- removed the `ListItemControl` component since it was implemented pretty badly.
  The new #list and #form packages should allow for this to be re-implemented in
  your app fairly easily though.
- removed the `TablePagination` and `TableCardHeader` components since I wasn't
  sure how helpful they were and didn't really work. The new #table styling
  behavior and customization should allow for a custom implementation fairly
  easily though.
- removed the `EditDialogColumn`, `SelectFieldColumn`, `*Column` components from
  the #table package since they aren't really needed anymore. Form elements
  should be renderable within tables without the weird hacks these components
  were implementing.
- removed the `Version` component since it was probably only ever used by the
  documentation site.

### What's new in v2?

This release focused on updating `react-md` to be as customizable as possible by
exporting a lot more low-level components, hooks, and utils that were used
internally. Something that I noticed from the v1 release is that if something
was not easily customizable or specific components were not public, it was
**easier to actually write your own version of that component**. This was a
major flaw and caused lots of problems especially since the majority of the
functionality behind these components were not reusable. The new components and
hooks should be able to help for these use cases but the down side is that
you'll still need to create a custom implementation for common patterns
throughout your app because some patterns seem repetitive.

#### Rewrite to Typescript

> Note: Upgrading to v2 of `react-md` does **not** require you to also use
> Typescript even though it is highly recommended to do so. You can still use
> `react-md` with JavaScript as you have done before, but all the examples and
> documentation will be written with Typescript.

[v1.1.0](https://mlaursen.github.io/react-md-v1-docs/#/discover-more/whats-new#v1-1-0-released) was the first `react-md`
release to add support for Typescript but unfortunately the type definitions
were [not that great]({{GITHUB_URL}}/blob/v1/src/js/index.d.ts) because I did
not fully understand Typescript and kept getting out of sync or forgotten. Since
Typescript is becoming the new trend for web development with additional tooling
and editor integrations, it seemed like a good time to finally start learning
Typescript and re-write `react-md` to use it natively.

One of the biggest pros for rewriting to Typescript is that now all the
documentation around Component props, hooks, or utils can now be viewed within
your editor or IDE if it supports the `"Go to Definition"` functionality due to
being compiled with the `*.d.ts` files now. In addition, the type definitions
should never be out of sync and should be much more strictly typed than before
since the entire library has been written in Typescript.

That being said, there are a few type definitions that could still be improved
in v2 especially around [generics and Records]({{GITHUB_URL}}/issues/859) so any
suggestions or PRs are welcomed.

#### New Behavior for Determining the Current Application Size

In v1, the `Drawer` and `NavigationDrawer` components were used to be able to
determine the current app size using the static methods: `getCurrentMedia` and
`matchesMedia`. This meant that the only way to determine the current
application size through media queries was to either:

- render a `Drawer` or `NavigationDrawer` components and hook into the
  `onMediaTypeChange` callback prop
- manually create a resize listener and use the
  `Drawer.getCurrentMedia`/`NavigationDrawer.getCurrentMedia` static methods
- implement a custom solution

This solution was pretty terrible and lead to confusion, out-of-sync behavior,
and bugs.

Starting with v2 these issues should be resolved due to React implementing the
new [Context API] along with the new [AppSizeListener] component and media query
SCSS mixins.

##### AppSizeListener Component and useAppSize Hook <!-- no-margin-bottom -->

The new `AppSizeListener` component should be mounted **once** near the root of
your app which will initialize multiple resize and media query event listeners
to determine what size your app is currently being rendered while the
`useAppSize` hook allows access to the current size.

Check out the [AppSizeListener] example for more details and a live demo.

##### Media Query Mixins and Components <!-- no-margin-bottom -->

In addition to the new component and hook, `react-md` now provides a few utility
SCSS mixins for applying styles at different media query sizes:

- [rmd-utils-phone-media]
- [rmd-utils-tablet-media]
- [rmd-utils-tablet-only-media]
- [rmd-utils-desktop-media]
- [rmd-utils-large-desktop-media]

There are also a few media query components which can be used to conditionally
render components based on the current application site. Check out the [Media
Query Components example] for some more information.

#### New Theme API

Since this release dropped IE 11 support, all the dynamic theming is done
through [Custom CSS Properties (CSS Variables)] with the new theme SCSS
functions and mixins. The root #theme package now provides a new `background`
and `surface` color variable to use along with a lot of [other themeable values]
while the other packages will provide themeable variables for colors, margin,
and padding. The new theme API allows you to easily modify existing themes
without all the boilerplate and "hacks" from the v1 release. Here is a quick
example:

####### v1 theme updates <!-- no-margin -->

```scss
.custom-theme--v1 {
  // create smaller icon buttons
  .md-btn--icon {
    height: 1rem;
    font-size: 1rem;
    width: 1rem;
  }

  // updating icon spacing
  .md-icon-text {
    $new-spacing: 0.5rem;

    &:first-child {
      padding-right: $new-spacing;
    }

    &:last-child {
      padding-left: $new-spacing;
    }
  }

  // change theme colors
  @include react-md-theme-colors($md-orange-500, $md-purple-a-200);
}
```

####### v2 theme updates <!-- no-margin -->

```scss
// in v2
.custom-theme--v2 {
  @include rmd-button-theme-update-var(icon-size, 1rem);
  @include rmd-icon-theme-update-var(text-spacing, 0.5rem);
  @include rmd-theme-update-var(primary, $rmd-orange-500);
  @include rmd-theme-update-var(secondary, $rmd-purple-a-200);
}
```

You can also reference the current theme values as a value or CSS Variable:

```scss
.custom-class {
  // use current background-color
  @include rmd-theme(background-color, background);

  // use the current primary text color on the current background color
  @include rmd-theme(color, text-primary-on-background);

  // use the current primary theme color as a border color (for some reason)
  @include rmd-theme(border-color, primary): ;

  // add 1rem to the current CSS Variable value for the icon text spacing
  padding: calc(#{rmd-icon-theme-var(text-spacing)} + 1rem);
}
```

The new theme API is pretty powerful and allows for a lot of new customization
without needing to modify the `react-md` internals and remembering specific
class names. Please check out the [creating dynamic themes] documentation for
more information.

> Disclaimer: This new theme API was heavily inspired by the
> [material components web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)
> library.

#### New Utility SCSS Functions and Mixins

This release added a bunch of new utility functions and mixins to add additional
styling throughout your app for common use cases such as:

- updating styles for right to left languages: [rmd-utils-rtl]
- applying styles for mobile devices only: [rmd-utils-phone-media]
- applying styles for tablets and above: [rmd-utils-tablet-media]
- applying a simple button CSS reset: [rmd-button-reset]
- updating a CSS variable's value for the theme package: [rmd-theme-update-var]
- checking if a color is considered light or dark: [rmd-theme-tone]
- and more!

#### Automatic Color Fixes for Accessible Contrast Ratios

The default styles from `react-md` will now **attempt** to automatically fix
contrast ratio issues between foreground and background colors using the new
[rmd-theme-tone] function. This appears to work for a great amount of use cases,
but it is still recommended to verify colors meet the recommended contrast ratio
for accessibility. You can check out the [Theme Builder] for a few examples of
contrast ratio issues by playing with the theme colors.

#### SCSS Variables and Default Values in JavaScript

Every SCSS variable is now automatically compiled with its default value and
written to a `dist/scssVariables.js` file for each package as a record of
variable names as keys and the default compiled value as the value. This allows
you to get access to each variable name as well as all the themeable CSS
Variables in JavaScript.

For example, if you want to get all the available material design colors from
the theme package, you can use the following code:

```ts
import scssVariables from "@react-md/theme/dist/scssVariables";

// get all the colors from the color palette
// only the color variables in this package will not be prefixed
// with rmd-theme
const colorKeys = Object.keys(scssVariables).filter(
  (name) => !/^rmd-theme/.test(name)
);
```

> Note: This will be strictly typed for Typescript users as well.

#### Improved Typography and CSS Reset

To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing with typography in v1 <sup>_(I
still don't really understand typography)_</sup> and defaulted to modifying the
default tags with `react-md` typography styles:

- `<h1> - <h6>`
- `<p>`
- `<caption>`
- `<input>`
- `<textarea>`
- `<button>`

Starting with v2, `react-md` will provide a much simpler
[CSS reset](/packages/utils/sassdoc#utils-mixin-rmd-utils-base) and not apply
any typography to html tags. In addition, the default typography styles can be
overridden or merged with new styles using the
[\$rmd-typography-styles variable](/packages/typography/sassdoc#typography-variable-rmd-typography-styles).
The new #typography package also exports two new components for general text
styling and reusable typography mixins.

#### Improved User Interaction States

A user interaction state is the feedback presented to the user when one of the
following actions happens:

- tap a clickable element on a touch device
- click a clickable element with the mouse
- focus an element with the keyboard

####### v1 implementation<!-- no-margin -->

![v1 implementation](https://i.imgur.com/MTxYr1e.mp4)

v1 of `react-md` had a very "noisy" implementation of this with the
[ripple/ink effect](https://mlaursen.github.io/react-md-v1-docs/#/components/inks) which caused a 300ms animation each
time the user interacted with a focusable element. This was _okay_ for the tap
and click behaviors but extremely obnoxious for keyboard users especially when
tabbing through elements quickly.

In addition there would sometimes be `:hover` styles applied accidentally after
a user touches an element on mobile since touch events also trigger the `:hover`
state. The rewrite for v2 has solved these issues by introducing interaction
states, providing mixins to dynamically apply styles based on an interaction
state, and providing a new keyboard focus state.

####### Starting with v2<!-- no-margin -->

![v2 implementation](https://i.imgur.com/wsvliUy.mp4)

The #utils package provides an `InteractionModeListener` that is bundled into
the `Configuration` component in the #layout package that helps determine which
interaction mode the user is currently using. This can be used along with the
following mixins for dynamically applying styles based on an interaction mode:

- [rmd-utils-touch-only]
- [rmd-utils-keyboard-only]
- [rmd-utils-mouse-only]

In addition, a new #states package has been added that implements the new
behavior for the ink/ripple effect that will now only trigger after a click
event instead of focus. The focus state has been drastically simplified to add
blue `box-shadow` and sometimes add a slight background color change while
keyboard focused. The new interaction states can be implemented for any
non-react-md component as well with the following mixins:

- [rmd-states-surface]
- [rmd-states-focus-shadow]
- [rmd-states-pressed-styles]
- [rmd-states-theme]
- [rmd-states-theme-update-var]

#### Improved Accessibility and Keyboard Movement

The v1 release of `react-md` implemented _some_ accessibility features and
keyboard movement but the majority of the behavior was incorrect and caused more
issues than it tried to solve. v2 is still not 100% perfect due to how
differently screen readers behave, but should now follow the specs outlined on
the [WIA-ARIA Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/)
website. Due to these fixes a lot of components will now correctly require an
`aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop which only required an `id` before.

The new keyboard movement behavior is drastically different now since components
now correctly follow the recommendations outlined in the WIA-ARIA Best practices
website. A new feature that is introduced in v2 is the ability to
"type-to-focus" elements in some complex components. The user can now focus a
component like the `Tree` or `DropdownMenu` and type letters to match the first
child that starts with those letters. In addition, lot of work has been made
into ensuring that keyboard focus is no longer lost while navigating between
temporary elements like menus and dialogs and implementing the new
`aria-activedescendant` movement when needed to keep focus on the correct
components. It is highly recommended to check out the [AutoComplete],
[DropdownMenu], and [Tree] components since the changes should be extremely
noticeable and a few of the demos showcase this functionality.

Finally, the accessibility helpers have been created as reusable hooks in the
##utils package so that non react-md components can implement this functionality
as well.

- [useFocusOnMount] - Focuses an element when the component mounts which
  defaults to the first focusable element child. Can be configured to focus the
  last child by default or a custom `document.querySelector` string.
- [usePreviousFocus] - Used in temporary elements like menus and dialogs to help
  ensure that keyboard focus is not lost once the temporary element is closed.
- [useTabFocusWrap] - A hook implementation of the `FocusContainer` that just
  provides a `onKeyDown` event handler for maintaining focus within a container.
- [useFocusMovement] - Provides the functionality to focus elements with custom
  key configurations.
- [useActiveDescendantMovement] - Provides the functionality to "focus" elements
  with custom key configurations by using the `aria-activedescendant` focus
  pattern which maintains focus on the "root" element
- [useKeyboardSearch] - A low-level hook for providing the "type-to-focus"
  behavior on components as an `onKeyDown` event handler.
- [useKeyboardMovement] - A low-level hook that is used by both the
  `useFocusMovement` and `useActiveDescendantMovement` to provide keyboard
  movement and optional search functionality.

#### Right to left Language Support

`react-md` will now automatically update the provided styles when a parent
element (normally the root `<html>`) for `dir="rtl"` to support right to left
languages. The following properties will be automatically inversed:

- `margin-left`
- `margin-right`
- `padding-left`
- `padding-right`
- `left`
- `right`

Since it might be required to update non-react-md components with these styles,
the #utils package also exports the following mixins to implement this behavior:

- [rmd-utils-rtl]
- [rmd-utils-rtl-auto]
- [rmd-utils-rtl-auto-group]

> The documentation site allows for a live preview for this functionality! If
> you are on desktop, click the right to left toggle button in the main header.
> If you are on mobile, click the kebab menu in the main header and then click
> the toggle right to left option.

This feature is enabled by default starting with v2 but can be disabled by
updating the
[rmd-utils-enable-rtl](/packages/utils/sassdoc#utils-variable-rmd-utils-enable-rtl)
variable:

```scss
$rmd-utils-enable-rtl: false;

@import "~react-md/dist/react-md";
```

#### Convenience Configuration and Context Provider Components

v2 of react-md heavily uses the [Context API] to implement different features
and configuration for things such as:

- changing the default icons used throughout `react-md`
- disabling the ripple behavior
- configuring the `theme` for different components
- determining the current application size

Check out the #layout package for more information since it provides a
`Configuration` component that combines all of these context providers into a
single component.

#### Around 50 new Components and 40 hooks

In order to allow more customization and reconfigurability within react-md, more
low level components are now exported as well as moving some functionality
within hooks.

#### All Material Icons Available as Components

Since it can be difficult to remember all the icon names or even mistyping a
font icon name, `react-md@v2` now provides every material icon as a `FontIcon`
and `SVGIcon` implementation. At the time of writing these release notes, there
are **932 icons available** which means **1864 icon components**. Check out the
##material-icons package for more info and previewing every icon.

#### Scoped Packages

Since v2 of `react-md` ended up being a complete re-write, I wanted to create a
way to be able to slowly update existing apps from v1 to v2 without forcing an
immediate re-write. Related components will now be grouped and published
together using the `@react-md` scope as well as the "root" `react-md` package
that exports everything like normal. If you are completely new to `react-md`, I
recommend just installing `react-md` while apps that are migrating should use
the scoped packages.

Please see the [scoped packages] documentation for a more in-depth write up.

#### New Documentation Site

The documentation site has been re-written to use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
instead of the extremely outdated custom implementation with different webpack
configs. This should hopefully allow contributors to get started more quickly
and apply changes as needed. Each page should now also provide a table of
contents to be able to quickly navigate to a specific heading, demo,
documentation, etc. There are also some other small other documentation
improvements that will be outlined below.

> Note: The search behavior needs to be fixed since it was hacked together in
> about 20 minutes. You should be able to find the majority of components other
> than the grid components. These can be found in the #utils package as
> `GridList` and `Grid`.

##### Improved Documentation <!-- no-margin-bottom -->

After reviewing feedback about the v1 documentation site, the main problem areas
were:

- unable to view the full context of the example code
- unable to live-edit the example code
- unable to see the default compiled value for SCSS variables
- not enough useful documentation around SCSS usage
- not enough information about the example

To solve the first two issues, a custom
[sandbox generator script]({{GITHUB_FILE_URL}}/packages/dev-utils/src/sandbox/index.ts)
was created that resolves every
[dependency and file name]({{GITHUB_FILE_URL}}/packages/dev-utils/src/sandbox/extract.ts#L58)
for each demo and generates a
[sandbox json file]({{GITHUB_FILE_URL}}/packages/dev-utils/src/sandbox/generate.ts#L139).
This allows for the new and improved
[DemoSandbox]({{GITHUB_FILE_URL}}/packages/documentation/src/components/DemoSandbox/DemoSandbox.tsx)
to render all the files for a demo as well as dynamically creating an editable
code sandbox using the
[codesandbox define API](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#define-api). Each
demo will now have a button to preview the code in the new `DemoSandbox`, create
an editable sandbox with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), and a directly
link to the source code within GitHub to help show the full context of the
demos. In addition, each demo was updated to hopefully be a lot less complex
than some that appeared in v1.

The third issue was solved by re-writing the
[sassdoc generator script]({{GITHUB_FILE_URL}}/packages/dev-utils/src/sassdoc.ts)
to
[hackily force compile the scss variable]({{GITHUB_FILE_URL}}/packages/dev-utils/src/utils/getCompiledScssVariable.ts#L134).
Now if a variable references another SCSS variable, the default compiled value
can be viewed by enabling the "Default Compiled Value" switch for that variable.
Check out the
[\$rmd-alert-theme-values variable](/packages/alert/sassdoc#alert-variable-rmd-alert-theme-values)
for a quick example.

The forth issue has not been solved completely, but there is now a new solution
in place by being able to render examples a bit easier within SassDoc and
showing the compiled value. The
[rmd-utils-rtl mixin](/packages/utils/sassdoc#utils-mixin-rmd-utils-rtl) has a
pretty good example to reference for this functionality.

The last issue about missing information for the example has hopefully been
solved by the new writing patterns throughout the documentation site. Each
example should now have a bit more information about the components being used
along with some background information about what the demo is trying to
accomplish. **Documentation is difficult** so please provide feedback for what
has been helpful and what has not.

#### GZip Size Comparison

The v2 release has decreased the UMD bundle size by `12.35%` while the CSS
bundles have increased by `18.56% - 18.75%`:

```sh
v1 size
The gzipped UMD bundle size is:
 - dist/v1/umd/react-md.min.js 98.68 KB

The min and max gzipped CSS bundle sizes are:
 - dist/v1/css/react-md.yellow-red.min.css 13.2 KB
 - dist/v1/css/react-md.blue_grey-deep_purple.min.css 13.23 KB

v2 size
The gzipped UMD bundle size is:
 - dist/umd/react-md.production.min.js 86.49 KB
 - dist/umd/react-md-with-font-icons.production.min.js 196.05 KB
 - dist/umd/react-md-with-svg-icons.production.min.js 196.03 KB

The min and max gzipped CSS bundle sizes are:
 - dist/css/react-md.grey-deep_orange-200-light.min.css 15.65 KB
 - dist/css/react-md.indigo-blue-400-dark.min.css 15.71 KB
```

In addition, v2 _should_ have finally solved the code splitting issue that
existing in v1 and produce an even smaller bundle if every feature within
`react-md` is not used.
