## v2.0.1

No changes.

## v2.0.0

This package is new for the v2 release, but replaces and expands upon the
existing theming and color system in v1. Starting with v2, the theme has
built-in support for automatically attempting to fix color contrast ratios.

### New Features / Behavior

- completely new theming system that utilizes functions, mixins, and CSS
  variables (applies to other `react-md` packages as well)
- provides functions and mixins to check color contrast ratios and updates the
  default theme automatically
- new mixins to switch your app to the `light` or `dark` modes which can be used
  with the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to automatically adjust based on
  user OS settings

### Breaking Changes

- `color` and `background-color` class names can no longer be generated for you
  with a mixin

#### New SCSS Variables, Functions, and Mixins

- `$rmd-theme-no-css-variables-fallback: true !default` - Boolean if the main
  `@mixin rmd-theme` should no longer provide a fallback value when a css
  variable is not set.
- `$rmd-theme-define-colors-with-rgba: false !default` - Boolean if the light
  and dark theme colors should be created with `rgba` instead of `lighten`.
- `$rmd-theme-on-primary` - An accessible text color to use on top of the
  primary color
- `$rmd-theme-on-secondary` - An accessible text color to use on top of the
  secondary color

  The background color to use for elevated surfaces

  used for color accessibility

  `dark`

  be `light` or `dark`

  variable
