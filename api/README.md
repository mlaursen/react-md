# react-md-api
This is a simple express server for sending either the PropTypes documentation,
sassdoc documentation, or quickly searching for some component.

Since I am lazy and don't want to have to compile this code, this project requires
node >= 6. You can use `nvm` to manage this for you if you are still running the
good ol' 4.x or something.

## Getting started

```bash
$ yarn # or npm install
$ npm run dev   # development
$ npm start     # production
```
